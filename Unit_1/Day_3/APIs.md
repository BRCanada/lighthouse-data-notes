# APIS
You can run an API from ANY programming language.
### Google Colab
Will interface directly with Jupyter Notebooks and Python

## Where do we get our data?
Data Mining
* PRogram that goes to URLS and parses the HTML to extract data
    * Effortful
    * HTML difficult to parse
    * Almost all information is irrelevant (e.g. UI-related)

### API CALLS
* Postman is a tool that makes api calls easier to create with a GUI
