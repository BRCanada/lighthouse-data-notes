# 7 Stages of Machine Learning
## 1. Data Gathering
Data gathering has been covered alot so far. Sample data can come in many forms, from csv files, to online databases, music or sound banks, aggregated text files, etc. Everything is data! So Gather it up!
<br>
## 2. Data Preparation
Data preparation is split up into multiple parts, and before we list them, it's important to note that *Data Wrangling* is considered a part of this stage. Therefore, Data Scientists spend most of their time here.
<br>
Data Prep can be split into the following parts:
* 1. [Data Exploration](https://www.saedsayad.com/data_exploration.htm):
    * Explore data
    * Explore the target variable (if we have one)
* 2. Find relationships between the target and other variables
* 3. Data cleaning
    * Replace missing values
    * Outlier detection
